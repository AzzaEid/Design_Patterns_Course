# 🎨  My Design Patterns Journey

Welcome to my personal exploration of **Design Patterns** while studying software design patterns — based on the classic and wonderfully illustrated book:  
📘 **Head First Design Patterns**

Yes, it’s that fun book with ducks, pizzas, and weather stations. And it’s surprisingly deep!

---

## 🚀 What’s in here?

For each pattern:
- 📂 Original implementation
- ✏️ Personal tweaks, notes & questions
- 🔁 Bonus: Refactors or modern C# variations

---

## 🧠 Patterns Covered So Far

✅ Strategy Pattern  
✅ Observer Pattern  
✅ Decorator Pattern  
✅ Factory (Simple & Factory Method)   
✅ ...and more on the way!

## 📌 Note ⭕

Be sure to check the **README.md inside each pattern folder** — that’s where I’ve tried to capture the theory, my questions, and a bit of my personal touch ✨

## ☕️ Why I’m Doing This?

Writing code is one thing.  
But writing code that feels **elegant, intentional, and satisfying to read** — that’s something else entirely.

Maybe I’m a little (or a lot) obsessed with making code “good enough to be called beautiful.”  
And honestly... if I hadn’t chosen software engineering, I might’ve ended up as an architect 
— building graceful structures, just in a different medium.🤷🏻‍♀️
